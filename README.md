# Twitter_Research
This is the code I wrote for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis I did in my undergrad. 

This project uses Python as the language and intergrates Twitter's API to scan their database for tweets.

I plan on using RNN for the sentiment analysis part of this project.

I am writing this in my free time, so updates may be sporadic for the time being.
